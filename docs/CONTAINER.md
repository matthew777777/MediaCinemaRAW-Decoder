# Version 3 container format

All integers are little-endian. This documents the `.mcraw` container read
by `mediacinemaraw::ContainerReader`. Frame payloads are described in
[FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md).

## File structure

```
bytes magic          # "MOTION " + version byte 0x03 (8 bytes)
item  container_metadata
item* frames, audio, motion
item  audio_index?   # only when audio was written
item* trailing motion data + motion indexes
item  frame_index
item  footer
```

Every item is `u32 type | u32 payload_size | payload bytes`.

## Item types

| Type | Name                | Payload                                          |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 0    | Footer              | `u32 magic (0x8A905612)`, `u32 frame_count`, `i64 frame_index_offset` |
| 1    | Frame index         | per frame: `i64 data_offset`, `i64 timestamp_ns` |
| 2    | Frame data          | one type 7 payload, followed by its item 3 metadata JSON |
| 3    | Metadata            | JSON bytes (container-level once, then per frame) |
| 4    | Audio index         | `i64 chunk_count`, `i64 first_timestamp_ms`, then per chunk: `i64 data_offset`, `i64 timestamp_ns` |
| 5    | Audio data          | PCM16 LE samples                                 |
| 6    | Audio timestamp     | `i64 timestamp_ns` (one, right after each chunk) |
| 8    | Gyro index          | `u32 version (1)`, `u32 chunk_count`, then per chunk: `i64 data_offset`, `i64 first_sample_timestamp_ns` |
| 9    | Gyro data           | `u32 version (1)`, `u32 sample_count`, then 24-byte samples |
| 12   | Accelerometer index | same layout as item 8                            |
| 13   | Accelerometer data  | same layout as item 9                            |

Type 7 is unused. Types 10/11 (OIS) are skipped, never surfaced. A motion
sample is `i64 timestamp_ns`, three `f32` axes, one `u32` reserved word.
Gyro axes are rad/s, accelerometer axes m/s^2 including gravity, in the
source platform axis convention.

`frame_index_offset` in the footer points at the frame index entries
(the item 1 payload), not at its header. The index list must abut the
footer exactly.

## Reader conventions

- Index discovery reads the footer first, then scans the pre-index region
  for the audio and motion indexes. An unknown item kind ends the scan the
  way the reference reader does.
- Offsets and sizes are validated before every read: items must stay inside
  the file, frame offsets inside the data region, timestamps unique.
- Frame JSON must carry `width`, `height`, and `compressionType`; only
  type 7 payloads are decoded.
- Audio chunks without a trailing timestamp item keep `-1` as their
  timestamp. Motion streams report absent via `hasGyroData()` /
  `hasAccelerometerData()` instead of throwing.
- Reads stream from disk; clips are never fully loaded.
